# Chee-Wee Chua (chewy)

 Welcome to my Github Profile!
 
 My name is Chee-Wee, and I'm all sorts of things, including:

- hacker
- software developer / engineer
- consultant

Some of my skill sets are listed in my [profile on Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/cwchua). So if you're interested to know more, visit there. If you're interested in adding me to your Linkedin connections, feel free to do so.

Brief history:

I wrote some of the demos shipped in commercial products such as: Delphi 2005, Delphi 8 for the Microsoft .NET Framework, Kylix 3 (C++), C# Builder Architect , RAD Studio XE, and RAD Studio XE2, RAD Studio Tokyo 10.2.

I started learning software development and ran my first BBS probably in the late 80s or early 90s - Information Unlimited and Programmers' Paradise. I can't remember which came first. My first language was either Prolog or x86 Assembly. Subsequently, I learnt Turbo Pascal and worked with it since then. I bought my first Delphi in 1996. I avoided C and C++ in the early 90s, and learnt Java in 2000. I finally took the plunge and learnt C/C++ around 2002-2005.

I have some experiences in systems administration, software development, systems integration, technical support, information security & auditing, and managing IP (Intellectual Property) at a strategic level. Previously, I had a lot of experience in setting up, installing, configuring and upgrading various operating systems (such as Windows, Linux, Mac OS and Solaris) and various databases (Oracle, InterBase, SQL) so it should not come as a surprise that I hold these certifications: ArcSight Certified Systems Analyst (ACSA), ArcSight Certified Integrator/Administrator (ACIA), Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA), Sun Certified Java Programmer (SCJP), Sun Certified System Administrator (SCSA), Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) and Qualified Information Security Professional (QISP). Frequently, I have been approached to provide solutions, software and services on a freelance, consulting and contractual basis.

Today, I use many technologies, platforms and languages including Android, Linux, macOS, Solaris, Windows, C#, Delphi, Go, Java, .NET, ArcSight, LogRhythm, AWS, Packer, Terraform and Vault.
