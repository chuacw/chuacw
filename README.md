 Welcome to my Github Profile!
 
 My name is Chee-Wee, and I'm all sorts of things, including:

Some of my skill sets are listed in my [profile on Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/cwchua). So if you're interested to know more, visit there. If you're interested in adding me to your Linkedin connections, feel free to do so.

Out of 20 million active Github accounts, I am ONE out of a million active Github accounts (meaning, 5%) who has repositories in the Arctic Code Vault.

I have experience in blockchain (including IPFS, NFT), systems administration, software development, systems integration, technical support, quality assurance, information security & auditing, and managing IP (Intellectual Property) at a strategic level. Previously, I had a lot of experience in setting up, installing, configuring and upgrading various operating systems (such as Windows, Linux, Mac OS and Solaris) and various databases (Oracle, InterBase, SQL) so it should not come as a surprise that I hold these certifications:

* Core Elasticsearch: Developer,
* Core Elasticsearch: Operations,

I'm also an Embarcadero MVP.

Frequently, I have been approached to provide solutions, software and services on a freelance, consulting and contractual basis.

Today, I use many technologies, platforms and languages including Android, Linux, macOS, Solaris, Windows, C#, Delphi, Go, Java, Move, Python, PHP, Solidity, Truffle, TypeScript, Nodejs, React, Rust, .NET, ArcSight, LogRhythm, AWS, Tencent, Packer, Terraform, Vault, etc.
